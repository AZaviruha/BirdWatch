#BirdWatch 

This is a **[Play 2.1](http://www.playframework.com)** dynamic web application written for fun and for explaining the concept of **Iteratees** in combination with consuming the **[Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis)** and updating a single page web app using a **[WebSocket](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)** connection. The visualization is done through the awesome **[D3.js](http://d3js.org)** data visualization library. 


There will be a series of blog postings covering the individual steps and explaning the concept of Iteratees soon.
